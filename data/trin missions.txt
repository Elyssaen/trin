# Wanderer Raids: Note that the Trin do not raid while the Pug are actively defending Ap'arak. Presumably this condition won't eventually be permanent, but in 0.9.5 it currently is. This is to prevent a Trin raid from destroying the two Arfectas defending Ap'arak, however unlikely that is. You should just assume that while the Pug are holding Ap'arak, they're also actively pre-emptively dealing with any Trin.

#0: Repeatable Hai missions hunting the Trin at high enough combat rating, and after proper first contact with the Hai.

#1: Board a pre-disabled Trin Piranha. Vindictive Quarg interference makes it easy to fail, but both outcomes continue the arc.

#2: Capture a Trin Piranha.

# Quarg Interlude: Meet a representative of the Quarg warning you not to get involved with the Trin matter.

#3: Travel to another system to pick up passengers to join the research team.

#4: Investigate a system (requires a Jump Drive) where Trin raids may originate from. (Will find nothing.)

#5: Return to the system to place a sensor array.

#6: Return to the Hai.

#7: Scan a Trin Chimaera detected in aforementioned system.

#8: Board a Trin Chimaera and obtain a Chimaera Black Box.

#9: A set of similar missions to loot: a Trin Ramscoop, an Etheric Web, a Strangelet Cell, one larger Strangelet reactor, and a Stasis Chamber. Sell to research team. The reactor path gives access to Strangelet Adapters.

#10: Board a mysteriously poorly armed Trin ship (a Cachalot) that may be a freighter, to work out why the Trin are occasionally sending ships not configured as warships to raid. Mission will end with the research team being shut down due to Quarg interference.

# MEBSUTA HIVE                                                                #
###############################################################################	

#1:  Start in Featherweight, asked to recruit someone to investigate strange tectonic activity on an uninhabited world in Mebsuta.

#2: Collect scanning equipment from the Deep.

#3: Take the team to the uninhabited planet in the system.

#4: Protect the team from a pirate raid. A Trin Raja or two will flee, and if possible take off from the planet as you do.

#5: Speak to the Navy at Farpoint to ask if they have any information about the strange ships seen.

#6: The Navy aren't familiar with the strange ships, except that one of the two was seen heading to Rigel. The other was reported destroyed in Alheka. Head to Rigel, where you'll find a graveyard of disabled pirates, merchants and Navy ships, and have to beat the (hostile) Raja.

#7: Admiral Danforth would like to reinforce Mebsuta with Navy presence, but it would be politically unpopular with Parliament lobby groups. He's sending communiques to the Parliament, to the Deep and the Quarg, but concludes the best approach is to launch a raid on Freedom/Almaaz to win a political victory and force northern pirates on the back foot, allowing for a fleet deployment to Mebsuta immediately after. Join the raid.

#8: Return from the raid to Farpoint.

#9: Head on to Mebsuta. Asked mid-way to land at Prime/Betelgeuse, on hearing that far more alien ships have appeared in Mebsuta and have wiped out the Featherweight colonies.

#10: Two Quarg Wardragons were reported to have showed up at Mirzam but were destroyed. The aliens are attacking Prime: the Navy reinforcements, and you, need to fend them off.

#11: Move on to Mebsuta in a suicide mission to try to rescue the survivors on Featherweight from alien bombardment. The Drak will show up and destroy the aliens (Trin) single-handedly. Heavy Quarg presence will show up elsewhere to deal with Trin stragglers.

#11B: Alternatively, reinforce the Navy's position in Splashdown/Canopus, helping fend off a second Trin force being resisted with Quarg help. Hear about the events at Mebsuta second-hand.

#11B.2: Head on to Mebsuta to see what happened.

#12: Return to Alnitak with Admiral Danforth and the Navy/Oathkeeper forces. Debrief.

# WANDERER DEFENCE                                                            #
###############################################################################	

#1: Repeating, help join a Wanderer fleet to fight off the Trin.

#2: As you have a Jump Drive, the Wanderers ask you to ask other species about the Trin. Has to link into the Hai string intelligently at any point. Leads to talking to the Quarg.

# Pug Interlude 1: after the above, can speak to the Pug about the Trin.

# Pug Interlude 2: randomly, once, on landing on the Pug Iyuk world, the Pug are attacked by the Trin. Arfectas are launched to fend them off and you can get a little more information.

#3: (south of Wanderer space) There's an increase in Trin raiding nearby. The Wanderers have noticed these trends and are concerned that, with their knowledge now of human space just to the south and with the Trin having Shunt Drives, the raid may reach human space. Go investigate the pirate systems south and use a scanner to detect any residue of Trin movement.

#4 etc. (this is the only arc where you actually have to directly defeat a Trin fleet without something like Archons coming to save the day)
